### Part 3
Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

### Positive aspects
- I appreciate the historical annotations on the various graphs -- it helps to put the numbers in context of important events.
- The red on the barchart evokes blood, which nicely complements the overall theme of the visualization.
- In general, the visualization is easy to read and conveys an ambitious amount of information compactly.


### Negative aspects
- It is confusing to have the bars directed downwards, yet displaying larger values in the negative direction. Because most barcharts associate more positive numbers with an upwards direction, this is a bit misleading at first glance.
- Between the bar chart, map, bubble chart, and donut graph, there is a ton of information displayed in this visualization all at once. Cutting down on the number of graphs displayed would help make the information more impactful.
- More focused and larger narrative arc (via text boxes) to guide the viewer through the visualization.
- The label on the bottom left, "Invasion to March 19, 2008," is ambiguously placed such that it's unclear to me which chart it's in reference to.

### My alternative approach
- In my alternative, I have eliminated the bubble chart on the bottom left and flipped the main barchart upside down. I haven't yet implemented this strategy due to time constraints, but plan revisit this task later in the week.
