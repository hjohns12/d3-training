# Assignment 1

## Viz 1:
Pros:
- Dodged bar charts make it easy to compare across products within each strategy type
- Colors are all distinct: easy to tell the difference between products

Cons:
- Two y-axes are challenging to interpret;
- Not immediately clear what the green line across the top means;
- Unclear what scale the values are on for "total of amount."

My approach:
- Stacked bar chart!
- Allows the viewer to immediately tell which strategy amounted in the highest sales AND sales by product
- Gets rid of the confusing double y-axis


## Viz 2:

Pros:
- Lots of information consolidated in one place
- Numbers on the stacked bar charts are legible
- Nice that the numbers match the color of the bar

Cons:
- No plot title
- No y-axis label; can't what units are being displayed
- Unclear what the percentages are indicating; lack of focus on what is trying to be conveyed

My approach:
- The top stacked bar chart is similar to the original, but less busy. This allows the viewer to see the total number of units sold by medicine type, in addition to the breakdown by company.
- The lower chart plots the relationship between percentage change and number of units sold. I notice that most of the huge percentage increases in the plot are associated with small number of units sold. This scatterplot allows the viewer to notice which products had positive growth with a small number of units sold, and products with positive growth with a large number of units sold.

## Viz 3:

Pros:
- Halloween-theme is festive :)
- "Spending on costumes" chart is easy to read, and the horizontal orientation makes it easier to read the labels

Cons:
- Difficult to perceive the size of circles/pumpkins
- Low data-to-ink ratio -- lots of extra ink here!
- The "adult participation rate" would make more sense stretching across the entire length of the graph

My approach:
- Creates four different sections, all in response to a question in the title. These guiding questions are meant to make it easier to understand what each chart is presenting.
- Removes the chart for adult participation, and adds them in as raw numbers.
- The other three elements are presented as simple bar charts for ease of interpretation.
