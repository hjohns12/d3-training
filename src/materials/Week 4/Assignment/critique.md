#### Part 3

### Good parts
- No excess information or ink -- this visualization is sparse and easy to read
- Easy to differentiate between colors
- Helpful to have numeric labels for more specific information.

### Possible improvements
- No chart title!
- The bars begin from the center and go in opposite directions, making it challenging to compare the two parties within category
- The placement of the category labels, flipping from right to left, is a bit confusing

### My approach
- My side-by-side bar chart makes it easier to compare party values within category. I throw in some labels on the axes and add a chart title, too!
