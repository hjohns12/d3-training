### Part 4
Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

### Positive Aspects
- Very easy to read: clear axis labels, title, and use of colors
- Low data-to-ink ratio
- I like the legend at the bottom of the plot rather than off to the side

### Negative Aspects:
- Double y-axis shouldn't be used!
- Y-axis label on the right doesn't start at zero
- Don't need number of orders on top of the bars
- Don't need "2014" on every x-axis label
- Could use more specificity in the title: number of orders of what?
- Nitpicky, but the graph title repeated in the axis labels seems redundant. I always like the graph title to be something more broadly informative about the graph.


### My Visualization:
- Because the amount of sales is collinear with the number of orders, I eliminate the "amount" line from the chart
- I change the title to something more broadly informative
- Remove the repeated "2014" from x-axis
- Lower the data-to-ink ratio by choosing a minimal theme
