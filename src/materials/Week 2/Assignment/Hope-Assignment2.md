# Assignment 2

## Viz 1 - Wine
### Pros
- Line plots on the upper left help the viewer see time trends quickly and clearly
- Pie chart colors are easily differentiable
- Interactive feature is nice

### Cons
- Overall, too much information to be quickly digestible
- Attempts to investigate long-term trends, especially in the "quarterly performance goal" segment
- "Sales pipeline information" segment gives excessive information, and should be pared down to convey only essential information
- Pie charts and line charts are conveying the same information; redundant

### My approach
- Create a panel on the left-hand side of metrics on the current month. This panel is easy to read, and highlights the best and worst performance among products and regions.
- Create a panel on the right-hand side with information on the status of the current quarterly goals being met in context of the past quarters.
- Guide to how much needs to be sold in order to reach quarterly goal.

## Viz 2 - Product Insight
### Pros
- Labels on each graph clearly indicate what is being shown
- Element of interactivity ("Jump to ____") allows user to view lots of information without being overloaded by all of it on one page

### Cons
- Color labels are "row X" and class labels are "column X"; very uninformative!
- The first line chart has a double axis, which is bad practice. This shouldn't be a line chart since the columns are not on a continuous scale.
- The second line chart is very confusing. The mixture of area, bars, and lines makes it hard for the viewer to understand what's being communicated. As the point of a dashboard is to quickly convey information, this chart fails to do so.
- Information shown in the 3D pie charts is best conveyed through a bar chart.

### My approach
- Create an opening page ("overall") with metrics reporting highlights in sales changes from the past month
- View separate pages for the type of dashboard and product focus
- First two panels show weekly/monthly progress by product type 
- Bottom panel shows change over time with line chart 

## Viz 1 - Football 
### Pros
- Visualization looks like a football field :) 
- Labels on the bars make the graph easier to read 

### Cons
- Color gradient is difficult to differentiate
- Stacked bar chart makes it challenging to compare the team percentages to the platform average within each time interval 

### My approach
- A dodged bar chart allows for easy comparison among off-season and regular season. It is simpler and more readable than the original.
- The team name, beneath the chart title, represents a drop-down menu in which the user could select a team. 
- If the user hovers over any bar, the percent will show up. 
- Overlay the platform average on the dodged bar charts. In the mock-up I only included the average for the first few time intervals, but in the actual version I would include them for all time categories. 
- Easily differentiable colors makes this chart more accessible than the original.
