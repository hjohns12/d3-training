## Positive Aspects
- If the viewer is new to chord diagrams, the introduction does a nice job of explaining how to read them!
- I like the inclusion of the "min threshold" slider bar. This makes it easy to identify countries with a large influx of refugees, something that I'm most interested in when looking at the visualization. The maximum threshold slider doesn't seem terribly useful, but perhaps someone likes to have it there!

## Negative Aspects
- For countries with a small number of refugees moving in and out, it's challenging to track where they're going to. For example, when I click on "Mali" as a source country, I can't easily tell where the refugees are going to. The capability to see a table for a selected country would be helpful.
- Although I know that Syria is the largest source of refugees, this isn't immediately apparent from the charts. Separating out the "from-country X within country X" hills onto another chart would help sort out the information.
- I find the amount of information being displayed to be overwhelming. Splitting the "source country" and "target country" charts into two tabs of the website may be a good starting place.
- Would be nice to spell out the acronym to IDPs somewhere on the page for reference.
- The number of total refugees displayed in the background of the chord diagram is not legible.
- Although I know that you can go all the way back to 1951, I can't find a year filter on the web page.

## My Changes
I implement the following changes:
- Since the chord diagram isn't an everyday visualization, I made in essence a bar chart to explain the same thing. This eliminates the need for a long explanation on the data, context, AND diagram.
