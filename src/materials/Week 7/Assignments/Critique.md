## Well-done:
- The overall map has a clean, modern feel;
- I appreciate that parks are highlighted with green spaces, since it helps explain the higher volume of monuments in certain areas;
- Visually appealing color scheme;
- Helpful to show the average value on the legend scale.


## Possible Improvements:
- The legend should have a better title than the column name displayed;
- The entire map should be zoomed in more closely;
- Confusing to have both circle diameter and color scale represent the density of monuments;
- Counterintuitive to make a lighter color represent a larger value;
- Knit-picky, but I like to have the maximum value on a scale end as a multiple of 10.

## My approach:
To bring more focus to this map, I've added in a more informative legend title and overall title. I removed the circle sizes and only have the color to represent the density of monuments at each park. Finally, I would add in an interactive feature such that when a user clicks on a given dot, an information box pops up with the park name and hours of operation.
